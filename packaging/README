This directory contains files and documentation for creating an rpm package of
the TMS KeyCmd utility.

Initial work on Rocky Linux 8, Tapis test VM tapisv3-vm2 (129.114.35.122)

Install git so we can checkout source:
  dnf install git

Add user "tms" for doing the checkout and packaging
  useradd -m tms

Install some supporting packages, not clear if all needed:
  dnf install rpmdevtools
  dnf install rpmlint
  dnf install epel-release

Record of procedure used on tapisv3-vm2 (as user tms):

  # Create the initial project
  rpmdev-setuptree
  # Move to the build dir
  cd rpmbuild
  # Set up the initial spec template
  rpmdev-newspec tms-keycmd
  # Update file SPECS/tms-keycmd.spec
  mv tms-keycmd.spec SPECS
  vi SPECS/tms-keycmd.spec
  # Copy the tms_keycmd pkg for current version to SOURCES
  cp /tmp/tms-keycmd-0.1.0.tgz ./SOURCES
  # Check spec file for errors
  rpmlint ./SPECS/tms-keycmd.spec
  # Create the .src.rpm file
  rpmbuild -bs ./SPECS/tms-keycmd.spec
  # Create the final .rpm file
  rpmbuild -bb ./SPECS/tms-keycmd.spec
  # NOTE can use -ba to build src.rpm and .rpm
  # To list contents of .rpm package, e.g.
  rpm -qlpv ./RPMS/noarch/tms-keycmd-0.1.0-1.el8.noarch.rpm
