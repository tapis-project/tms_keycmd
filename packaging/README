This directory contains files and documentation for creating an rpm package of
the TMS KeyCmd utility.

Initial work on Rocky Linux 8, Tapis test VM (129.114.35.122)

Install git so we can checkout source:
  dnf install git

Add user "tms" for doing the checkout and packaging
  useradd -m tms

Install some supporting packages, not clear if all needed:
  dnf install rpmdevtools
  dnf install rpmlint
  dnf install epel-release
  dnf install mock
  dnf install dnf makecache --refresh
  dnf install fedora-packager
  dnf install rpmautospec
TBD - Use rust2rpm, how to install?

For mock, need to add user "tms" to the group:
  usermod -G mock -a tms
